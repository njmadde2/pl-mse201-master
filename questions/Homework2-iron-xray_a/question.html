    A sample of iron was placed in an X-ray diffractometer at 1000 °C and a multitude of peaks was obtained. If the first peak (I) is observed at $\text{q}^{I}_{hkl}$ = {{params.qI}} $\text{Å}^{-1}$ calculate  $\text{q}^{II}_{hkl}$ if iron arranges in a BCC or FCC structure.

$q$II-BCC= <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.qIIBCC" /> $\text{Å}^{-1}$

<p>
$q$II-FCC= <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.qIIFCC" /> $\text{Å}^{-1}$
