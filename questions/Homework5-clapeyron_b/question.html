<p>
Andalusite is a mineral with chemical formula Al$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ that forms at low pressure and low-to-high temperatures. Kyanite and Sillimanite are other polymorphs of the same mineral occurring at different Pressure-Temperature ranges. The molar volumes for Andalusite, Sillimanite, and Kyanite are 51.5, 49.8, and 44.2 cm$^{3}$, respectively.The enthalpy of transformation Andalusite to Sillimanite is 2.9 kJ/mol.
