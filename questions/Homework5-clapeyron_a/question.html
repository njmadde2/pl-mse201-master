Andalusite is a mineral with chemical formula Al$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ that forms at low pressure and low-to-high temperatures. Kyanite and Sillimanite are other polymorphs of the same mineral occurring at different Pressure-Temperature ranges. The molar volumes for Andalusite, Sillimanite, and Kyanite are 51.5, 49.8, and 44.2 cm$^{3}$, respectively.

<p>
The enthalpy of transformation Andalusite to Sillimanite is 2.9 kJ/mol. Calculate the slope of the boundary line for the transformation of one mole of Andalusite into Sillimanite at T = {{params.T}} K. (1 Joule = 10 bar.cm$^{3}$).
