<p>
<img src="<% print(questionFile("diagram.png")) %>" width ="400px" class="img-responsive center-block" />
</p>
<p>
What is the composition of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ in the Liquid and the Mullite phases for a sample at the conditions marked by point X in the diagram?
</p>
<p>
Liquid = <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.L"/> wt% of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$
</p>
<p>
Mullite = <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.M"/> wt% of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$
</p>
