Determine the rate, $V$ ($V$=Flux × Area), at which helium (He), held at 5 atm and 200°C in a Pyrex glass bulb of {{params.diam}} cm diameter and a wall thickness of {{params.thickness}} cm, diffuses through the Pyrex to the outside. Assume that the pressure outside the bulb at all times is zero. The permeability constant for He in Pyrex is ${P}_\text{M}$ = 10$^{–9}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$atm$^{-1}$.
