The rate, $V$ ($V$=Flux Ã— Area), of Carbon Dioxide (CO$_{2}$) diffusion through a bottle of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) at room temperature is ${V}$ = 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ $\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}$. 
The permeability constant of $\text{CO}_{2}$ in PET is ${P}_\text{M}$ = 2 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$atm$^{-1}$. 
The area of the bottle is {{params.area}} cm$^{2}$. CO$_{2}$ is at pressure of 4 atm inside the bottle and 1 atm outside. Calculate the thickness of the bottle walls.
