A sample of iron was placed in an X-ray diffractometer at 1000 °C and pressure of 1 bar. At these conditions iron is in an FCC arrangement. A multitude of X-ray diffraction peaks was obtained. The first peak (I) is observed at $\text{q}^{I}_{hkl}$ = {{params.qI}} $\text{Å}^{-1}$. At 1394 °C and 1 bar the material experiences a FCC to BCC phase transition. Estimate what the unit cell dimensions of the material would be under conditions of no thermal expansion.
