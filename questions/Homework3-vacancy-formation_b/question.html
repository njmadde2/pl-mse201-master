Consider that $\Delta$H$_{v}$ = {{params.ener0}} eV is the energy necessary to create a vacancy in a particular metal. At {{params.T1}}ºC there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms.

<p>
What is the temperature change required to achieve 1 vacancy every 1,000 atoms in a system that the activation energy is just 1 eV lower than the $\Delta$H$_{v}$ mentioned above ?
