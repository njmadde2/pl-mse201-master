The storage of hydrogen in fuel tanks has been improved over the years by clever engineering solutions. It is predicted that soon a fuel tank of {{params.liters}} liters capacity will accommodate {{params.kilos}} kg of $\text{H}_{2}$.

<p>
What would be the required size (radius) of a 0.5 m high cylindrical fuel tank to store {{params.kilos}} kg of $\text{H}_{2}$ if this was kept at standard temperature and pressure?</p>
<p>
New radius = <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.radius2" />$\text{cm}$.
