If Polyethylene (PE) is branched, it is no longer 100% crystalline. For a density of crystalline PE of 0.998 g/cm$^{3}$, determine the percentage of crystallinity of a sample of branched PE that has a density of {{params.rhos}} g/cm$^{3}$. The density of the amorphous region is {{params.rhoa}} g/cm$^{3}$.
