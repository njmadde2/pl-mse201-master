If we have 100 grams of a sample at conditions marked by X, how many grams of Mullite can we produce? And how many grams of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ are present in Mullite? 
</p>
<p>
Mullite = <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.M"/> g
</p>
<p>
Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ in Mullite = <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.al2o3"/> g
