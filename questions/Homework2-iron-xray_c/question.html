A sample of iron was placed in an X-ray diffractometer at 1000 °C and a multitude of peaks was obtained. The first peak (I) is observed at $\text{q}^{I}_{hkl}$ = {{params.qI}} $\text{Å}^{-1}$ and the second peak at $\text{q}^{II}_{hkl}$ = {{params.qII}} $\text{Å}^{-1}$. At 1200 °C the unit cell volume of the material expands 10% without a change in crystal structure. Calculate the expected distances between the (111) and the (200) planes at higher temperature.
