The electron energy levels of the hydrogen atom according to the Bohr theory are given by: $$\text{E}_{n} = -\frac{13.605}{n^{2}}\text{ eV}$$.
</p>
<p>
What type of radiation occurs when an electron hops from the energy level $n$ = {{params.n1}} to $n$ = {{params.n2}} (i.e., what is the $\lambda$ of the transition?)</p>
<p>
$\lambda$ = <input data-instavalue="submittedAnswer.lambda" /> nm.
