The rate, $V$ ($V$=Flux Ã— Area), of Carbon Dioxide (CO$_{2}$) diffusion through a standard size bottle of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) at room temperature is ${V}$ = 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$. 
If about {{params.vco2}} cm$^{3}$ of CO$_{2}$ permeates out of the bottle, the soda is considered "flat". How much time will it take for the soda to go flat?
